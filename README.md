## Description
The main objective of this project is to create a employee directory app with the help of React (Components), axios and Node.js. Application's UI needs to be broken up into components, manage their component state, and respond to user events. Users can see random employees with photo ID, full name, gender, location and email ID. Also, users can search-filter current employees by typing their firstname, lastname, email or location from table-search box.

## User Story
 As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Technologies
- React (Components), axios, & Node.js.
